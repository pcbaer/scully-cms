# ScullyCMS

ScullyCMS is a simple all-in-one Content Management System that does not need a database.

## Basic ideas

* ScullyCMS does not need a database server. It saves content in local files (maybe JSON).
  * This idea is based on CMSimple by Gert Ebersbacher.
* ScullyCMS does not interprete PHP pages. It compiles static HTML pages whenever possible.
  * This idea is based on the TYPO3 extension staticfilecache.
